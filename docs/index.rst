Overview
========

The **dual_autodiff** library leverages dual numbers to enable forward-mode automatic differentiation, a powerful technique for symbolic differentiation. This is particularly useful for applications requiring precise and efficient derivative computations, such as optimization, machine learning, and scientific computing.

Dual Numbers and Automatic Differentiation
------------------------------------------

Dual numbers are an extension of real numbers designed to compute derivatives through symbolic propagation. A dual number is expressed as:

.. math::

    x = a + b \epsilon

where:

- **a** is the real part,
- **b** is the dual part, representing the derivative, and
- **ε** is an infinitesimal element with the property :math:`\epsilon^2 = 0`.

By defining operations on dual numbers, such as addition, multiplication, and elementary functions (e.g., `sin`, `cos`, `exp`, `log`), we enable automatic differentiation through the `Dual` class.

Installation
============

To install **dual_autodiff**, simply use the following pip command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

This command installs the package in editable mode, which is helpful for development purposes. Changes made to the code are immediately reflected without the need for reinstallation.

Usage
=====

### Basic Example with the Dual Class

The **Dual** class represents a dual number with real and dual parts, enabling automatic differentiation.

.. code-block:: python

    from dual_autodiff import Dual

    # Initialize a dual number with real part 2.0 and dual part 1.0
    x = Dual(2.0, 1.0)

    # Perform operations on the dual number
    y = x ** 2  # Computes x^2 using the Dual class
    print(y)  # Expected output: Dual(real=4.0, dual=4.0)

The result's real part is the value of the function, and the dual part provides the derivative.

### Using the differentiate Function

The **differentiate** function allows you to compute the derivative of a function at a specific point.

.. code-block:: python

    from dual_autodiff.autodiff_tools import differentiate

    # Define a function for differentiation
    def func(x):
        return x ** 2 + 3 * x

    # Compute the derivative at x=3
    derivative_at_3 = differentiate(func, 3.0)
    print(derivative_at_3)  # Expected output: derivative value at x=3

This function initializes a dual number with a dual component of 1 to propagate derivative information through the computation.

API Documentation
=================

### The Dual Class

The `Dual` class provides support for arithmetic operations and elementary functions on dual numbers, allowing automatic differentiation. Key methods include:

- **`__add__`**: Adds two dual numbers or a dual number and a float.
- **`__sub__`**: Subtracts a dual number or a float.
- **`__mul__`**: Multiplies by another dual number or a float.
- **`__truediv__`**: Divides by another dual number or a float.
- **`sin()`**: Computes the sine of a dual number.
- **`cos()`**: Computes the cosine of a dual number.
- **`exp()`**: Computes the exponential function.
- **`log()`**: Computes the natural logarithm, raising a `ValueError` for non-positive inputs.

### differentiate Function

The **differentiate** function calculates the derivative of a function at a specified point. It operates by initializing a dual number with a dual component of 1, allowing derivatives to propagate through the function.

Analytical Solutions and Test Cases
===================================

This package includes several test cases with expected analytical solutions to verify correctness:

1. **Quadratic Function** \( f(x) = x^2 \): Expected derivative at \( x = 3 \) is 6.
2. **Trigonometric Function** \( f(x) = \sin(x) \): Expected derivative at \( x = 0 \) is 1.
3. **Composite Function** \( f(x) = e^x \cdot \ln(x) \): Expected derivative at \( x = 2 \) is \( e^2 \cdot (\ln(2) + 0.5) \).

Refer to the analytical solutions section for further details.
